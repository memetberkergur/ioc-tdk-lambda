## Channel Access

The vscode developer container auto forwards the channel access ports on the loopback interface. If you have channel access clients running on the host machine, you can connect to the IOC by setting the `EPICS_CA_NAME_SERVERS` environment variable as follows:

```bash
export EPICS_CA_NAME_SERVERS=127.0.0.1:5064
caget IOCNAME:PVNAME
```
